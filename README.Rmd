This file will ultimately generate the README.md

It will pull from <https://github.com/Openscapes/series/blob/master/agenda-2month.Rmd>, or be created from a Google Sheets registry like we've done here: <https://github.com/OHI-Science/onboarding/blob/main/index.Rmd>.

Then we can edit the README.md directly to make any modifications.
