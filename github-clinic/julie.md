# The power of open science: publishing with GitHub

We can use GitHub to publish on the open web. GitHub supports Markdown formatting. Here are a few examples:

We can make words **bold**, *italic*, or [hyperlinked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink).

We can make lists that are automatically numbered *Note that lists need a carriage return before list items!*

1. bananas
1. tamales
1. cakes

As we saw above, Markdown hyperlinks use the `[]()` pattern: you put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`.

Learn more on the [palmerpenguins webpage](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins).

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. *Note that from the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.*

**Play around, what else can you change or add?**

You can also use HTML within Markdown for a little more control...
